# Pres Start

A learning project to get dive back into React and all the cool new front-end stuff like Tailwind CSS, Vite, new ways to do icons, and motion. 

### I used AI...
to learn and stuff. I'd write a component, get it working all nice, add some of the nifty stuff like aria bits, then ask the AI what it would add. Like asking somebody much smarter than you how they would do it - if you've got the option, it's usually a good idea. It's actually exactly how I learned a lot of things, just this time I'm doing it with AI instead of Josh or whomever (there's always a Josh - I had two). Anyways, I wrote a ton of this but there's some stuff that got copied and pasted. I feel like I need to say that - I wasn't vibin'.

## Built with React
That was the whole point of this project. I used React years ago, I've been UX'ing for years, I want to get back into coding and I want to get back into React.

## Uses Tailwind CSS
Tailwind is awesome. It felt crazy natural despite having never used it before (especially coming from SCSS and several years of not coding).  

## Uses MUI
I've used Material for projects before, but always on the Figma side of things for prototyping and stealing their icons! Which is what I did here. I stole the icons from Material and used them in this project.

## Uses Motion
I am super familiar with Framer Motion/Motion and I used motion.js or whatever version of that used to be around (back in the day). But, I had never used this - it's nice. I like the motion divs - I still like the way GSAP does some stuff, but this is a lot easier.

## Sits on Vite
I like Vite, but I did not utilize much of it's coolness in this project. It does sit on it though!

## Uses React Router
I had used this before, and they made it better. _Like, significantly better._ Or at least, it's a lot more logical. Or easier. Well _I like it better_, for reasons.
