# Pres Start

A learning project to get dive back into React and all the cool new front-end stuff like Tailwind CSS, Vite, easier icons, inline styles what are you people doing???

I kid, Tailwind is awesome.

## Built with React
That was the whole point of this project. I used React years ago, I've been UX'ing for years, I want to get back into coding and I want to get back into React.

## Uses Tailwind CSS
Tailwind is awesome. It felt crazy natural despite having never used it before (especially coming from SCSS and several years of not coding).  

## Uses MUI
I've used Material for projects before, but always on the Figma side of things for prototyping and stealing their icons! Which is what I did here. I stole the icons from Material and used them in this project.

## Uses Motion
I am super familiar with Framer Motion/Motion and I used motion.js or whatever version of that used to be around (back in the day). But, I had never used this - it's nice. I like the motion divs - I still like the way GSAP does some stuff, but this is a lot easier.

## Sits on Vite
I like Vite, but I did not utilize much of it's coolness in this project. It does sit on it though!

## Uses React Router
I had used this before, and they made it better. _Like, significantly better._ Or at least, it's a lot more logical. Or easier. Well _I like it better_, for reasons.
